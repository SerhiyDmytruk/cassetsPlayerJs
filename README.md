## Created with CodeSandbox simple player and refactored.

Playground and cheatsheet for learning Js. :v:
The main idea was try to understand how to work media and how to use API Deezer.

- Use API from Deezer;
- use Icomoon fonts;

For recompile styles and js use command `webpack`.

I use 3 most I liked songs for those player.
